# WAEC Result Statistics 
 ## This is the visualization Nigeria's Food Prices from 2016 - till date. 
 The data used were gotten from the Nigeria Nationa Bureau of statistics as linked in the dashboard while the data processing steps that yielded the used data is acessible as [a jupyter notebook](https://github.com/EwetoyeIbrahim/WAEC-Result-Statistics), which is also still under development.
   
 _This is part of my about-to-be-launced project, **Equimomolar**. Support is highly needed._  

 I shall continue to update it as new data becomes available.
